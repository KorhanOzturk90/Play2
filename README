This is a basic Play2 application for demonstrating how useful, easy and fun to code with Play Framework.

It stars with a simple index screen identical to DVLA's vehicle query screen (https://www.gov.uk/get-vehicle-information-from-dvla)

Once the "Start Now" button is pressed it will take you to search screen where you will be prompted to enter the plate number
 and the make of the car you want to search. Note that the application does not use any database and the sample cars are stored and
 read from vehicles.txt file on the root level.

Upon completion of the required fields the app will bring you the basic information for the car, if found, or will display error message.

There is a small testing via Scala Specs2 covering the functionality of the search with plate number and make of the car.
